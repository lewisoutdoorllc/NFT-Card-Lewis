## Project Details

This is a demo of a couple of ways to style and use a few different CSS properties on cards in general. Some of the effects from a UI standpoint may not necesically work together but as stated above the main point is to show a few diffenent effects you may not have seen before. Feel free if you like anything to use as you would like. 

More to come...
